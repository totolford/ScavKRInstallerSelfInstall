Simple windows installer of a [Co-op multiplayer mod](https://github.com/Krokosha666/cas-unk-krokosha-multiplayer-coop) for [Scav Prototype](https://orsonik.itch.io/scav-prototype).

Downloads and unpacks BepInEx and the latest version of the mod into the game's folder.

Optionally downloads and installs the correct game version.

If the mod is already installed, updates it with the latest version.

Apparently works on Linux under Wine with .NET 8.0 runtime installed, but not officially supported.
